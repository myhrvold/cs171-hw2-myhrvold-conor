<p>
Here I briefly describe my Problem 4 implementation:
</p>

<p>
My idea, discussed with my group, was to have nodes represent unique users instead of (unique) commits. In this regard, this is a people oriented visualization, not a code one, made to see collaboration and/or productivity. This would be useful for someone who is generally in charge of a project's outcome but who does not run it day to day.
</p>

</p>
Each unique user is a node. Hover over node, and you get the user name with the number of commits. (I tried to display the number permanently in the center of the node but was unable to do so, due to some sort of conceptual glitch I had with not being able to grab the x&y positions even though I could locate them in the JavaScript console; they returned undefined.)

Make links -- have link number displayed to right of link
Have link thickness be in accordance with # of collaborations between the
2 people...
